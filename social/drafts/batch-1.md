## Tweet 2 (Doubles Tip)
Most doubles points are lost because of bad rotation, not bad shots.

Front-and-back on attack. Side-by-side on defense. Sounds simple but how often does your partner actually know the plan?

Plan it out first → CourtSim (free on Play Store)

## Tweet 3 (Engagement — Poll)
Doubles players, honest question:

Do you and your partner actually discuss court positioning before a match?

🔥 Every time
😅 Sometimes
💀 We just wing it
🤔 Wait, you're supposed to?

## Tweet 5 (Tip — Positioning)
The T-position in doubles isn't just for serving.

After every return, both players should reset relative to the T. Most club players chase the shuttle and forget to reposition.

Drill it with CourtSim 🏸
