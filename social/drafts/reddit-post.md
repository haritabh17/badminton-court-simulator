I built a free badminton court simulator for planning doubles formations

## Body

Hey everyone,

I play doubles regularly and got tired of trying to explain court rotations to my partner using hand gestures and scribbles. So I built an app for it.

**CourtSim** is a free, no-ads badminton court simulator where you can:

- Drag and drop players on a realistic court
- Switch between singles and doubles
- See movement trails to visualize rotations
- Customize players with photos, colors, and labels
- Undo/redo to compare different formations

It's designed to be dead simple — open the app, drag players around, done. No account, no signup, no nonsense.

I mainly use it before matches to quickly show my partner "you go here after the serve, I cover there" instead of trying to explain it verbally.

It's free on Google Play: [link]

Would love feedback from the community. What features would make this actually useful for your training? Thinking about adding save/export for formations and maybe preset drill patterns.

Cheers 🏸
